     <h1 style="font-size:1vw">Sanrio created Kuromi in 2005, designed to be My Melody's enemy even tho there are many picture's of her and Melody as friends. She is a mischievous white rabbit tomboy, who was "born" on Halloween. Even tho Kuromi is depicted as the "enemy" in almost all Sanrio character games, she has become very popular, so popular in fact that the company was even supprized as they didnt think she would become this loved by consumer,fans, and placed third in Sanrio's 2022 Character Ranking.</h1>
