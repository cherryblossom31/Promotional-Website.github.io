     <h1 style="font-size:1vw">In 2011 Sanrio created Cinnamoroll, the long-eared wonder pup! With his fluffy white tail shapped like a cinnamon roll which gave him his name, and long-ears that give him the abilitty to fly. Cinnamoroll has gained a tone of popularity because of his cute puppy design and placed number one in Sanrio's 2022 Character Ranking. Due to his huge popularity in Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Japan there is a place called Cinnamoroll Cafe, where all of their food, drinks, and even the cafes interior design is all decorated based on Cinnamoroll and his friends. </h1>
