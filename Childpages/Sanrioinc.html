Sanrio has seen a big boom in increased popularity in gen Z's and characters are starting to be seen once again in more stores for stationery, clothes, and accessory. Sanrio created each character designed to be able to connect with people, and each created a back story along with a personality Which is what made Sanrio's characters popular in the first place, and also because of the cute design.</h1>
